First, it marks any target object (DID Subject), which can be a person, a commodity, a A machine or an animal, etc.: Second, DID is a unique identifier associated with a document (DID Document, DID Doc) describing the target object through DIDURL, that is, a specific DID Doc can be searched in the database through DID.',
		jjxq2:'The process of creating a DID Document is Production, and referencing the created Document to the DIDSubject and other DID creation processes is Consumption. During the verification process, the DID Document corresponding to each DID is independent, which is equivalent to information isolation for each DID. During the verification process, the DID holder can authorize different DIDs as needed, and the verifier can only read the authorized DID Doc, but cannot obtain more information, so as to achieve the information protection purpose of the DID Subject.'
